# DCI-orientation-course-09-23
DCI Berlin orientation course starts in September 2023
These projects are for educational purposes.
I will share the things we learned about Web Development. Mostly HTML and CSS.

I share the projects we have done, they are ordinary, as for the days I have different versions of the task itself where we used our own research on the Internet to do it.
I use images downloaded from the Internet, not for advertising purposes.
Hope I'm not infringing copyright with this.
Please if anyone notices any irregularity in this inform me so that I can remove them from my profile.
