              Argument in the kitchen set for and against the use of cooking
              fat.
            </h3>
            <p>
              "What? Did someone say there's fog outside? It looks clear to me."
              No, the acronym "FOG" stands for Fat, Oil, and Grease—cooking fat,
              in other words. In this article, we're going to explain ways of
              dealing with cooking fats safely and responsibly. What you're
              about to read might cause you to re-examine some of your existing
              practices, though, so be prepared to find out some better
              alternatives. For instance, dumping your used cooking fat down the
              drain is definitely not the thing to do! We'll discuss several
              alternative ways to dispose of grease, but we'll stress the most
              environmentally-friendly methods first and foremost.

            <p>
              Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay chooses the winner of Fox’s reality
              TV show “Hell’s Kitchen” each season after cutting down his field

              claimed the top honor so far since 2005, which ones do we remember
              fondly and who fizzled out after the finish line? Scroll through
              our photo gallery below that ranks all of the past “Hell’s
              Kitchen” winners from worst to best. Can you guess who’s our #1
              choice? Gallery originally published May 2018.
