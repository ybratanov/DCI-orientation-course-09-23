          <h3>Nintendo World</h3>
          <p>
            The world of Nintendo has undergone many changes over the years.
            Changes in games, changes in hardware. But for people the classic
            will be remembered NES

          <h3>For those who are fans</h3>
          <p>
            We 90s kids grew up with classic games like Super Mario Bros, Battle
            Tank, Nindas, Contra Force and many more. There were no flat screen
            TVs then, but there were fun times with friends..

          <h3>Do you know</h3>
          <p>
            LoThat years are just numbers on your ID. You don't have to stop
            playing or collecting your favorite things. Even if they become an
            old Nintendo game console. Because after a while we will tell
            stories to the children, to our children, what game consoles there
            were.

          <h3>Super Mario Bros</h3>
          <p>
            What memories just... trying to save the princess from the villain.
            How many hours have we spent behind the old TV struggling with the
            last eighth level. That's where things became the most difficult, as
            is the idea of the levels themselves becoming more difficult. After
            some time we found out about shortcuts.

          <h3>The other fun games</h3>
          <p>
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet....I played so many games, even now I
            wouldn't think of most of them. But Battle Tanks, Counter Force,
            Glaxie, Sonic the Hedgehog, even the Ducks with that annoying dog
            that laughed when you missed the target. I would gladly make such a
            site, but it is a matter of copyright.

          <h3>Interesting about this project.</h3>
          <p>
            For this task we have to use Flex-box properties. With the help of
            w3school, I think it can become an even more interesting website,
            but that will be for the next homework..
