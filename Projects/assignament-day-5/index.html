      <div class="info-magic"><h3>Something about magic</h3>
        Magic, sometimes spelled magick,[1] is an ancient practice rooted in
        rituals, spiritual divinations, and/or cultural lineage‚Äîwith an
        intention to invoke, manipulate, or otherwise manifest supernatural
        forces, beings, or entities in the natural world.[2] It is a categorical
        yet often ambiguous term which has been used to refer to a wide variety
        of beliefs and practices, frequently considered separate from both
        religion and science.

      <div class="info-magic"><h3>also...</h3>
        Connotations have varied from positive to negative at times throughout
        history,[4] Within Western culture, magic has been linked to ideas of
        the Other,[5] foreignness,[6] and primitivism;[7] indicating that it is
        "a powerful marker of cultural difference"[8] and likewise, a non-modern
        phenomenon.[9] During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century,
        Western intellectuals perceived the practice of magic to be a sign of a
        primitive mentality and also commonly attributed it to marginalised
        groups of people.[8]

      <div class="info-magic"><h3>maybe something else</h3>
        In modern occultism and neopagan religions, many self-described
        magicians and witches regularly practice ritual magic;[10] defining
        magic as a technique for bringing about change in the physical world
        through the force of one's will. This definition was popularised by
        Aleister Crowley (1875‚Äì1947), an influential British occultist. This
        view has been incorporated into chaos magic and the new religious
        movements of Thelema and Wicca. Etymology

      <h3>Etymology</h3>
      The English words magic, mage and magician come from the Latin term magus,
      through the Greek ŒºŒ¨Œ≥ŒøœÇ, which is from the Old Persian magu≈°. (êé∂êé¶êé¢êèÅ|êé∂êé¶êé¢êèÅ,
      magician).[11] The Old Persian magu- is derived from the
      Proto-Indo-European meg ∞-*magh (be able). The Persian term may have led to
      the Old Sinitic *MŒ≥ag (mage or shaman).[12] The Old Persian form seems to
      have permeated ancient Semitic languages as the Talmudic Hebrew magosh,
      the Aramaic amgusha (magician), and the Chaldean maghdim (wisdom and
      philosophy); from the first century BCE onwards, Syrian magusai gained
      notoriety as magicians and soothsayers.[13]

        <h3>maybe something else</h3>
      Historian Owen Davies says the term "white witch" was rarely used before
      the 20th century.[15] White magic is understood as the use of magic for
      selfless or helpful purposes, while black magic was used for selfish,
      harmful or evil purposes.[16] Black magic is the malicious counterpart of
      the benevolent white magic. There is no consensus as to what constitutes
      white, gray or black magic, as Phil Hine says, "like many other aspects of
      occultism, what is termed to be 'black magic' depends very much on who is
      doing the defining."[17] Gray magic, also called "neutral magic", is magic
      that is not performed for specifically benevolent reasons, but is also not
      focused towards completely hostile practices.[18][19]
