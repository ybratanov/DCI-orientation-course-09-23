      <h2>Order in Berlin </h2>
      Berlin’s culture is vibrant and sociable, but it’s also steeped in history. Its past is reflected best in the
      remains of the Berlin Wall, which travellers can visit to this day. The city comes to life after the sun goes down
      and the clubs wake up. You’ll find beer gardens, cocktail lounges, and symphonies to keep you entertained until
      dawn. During the daylight hours, take a stroll through its Museum fur Naturkunde, which exhibits one of the
      best-preserved T-Rex skeletons in the world. It also has a huge collection of insect models and an evolution hall.
      The Pergamonmuseum will introduce you to architecture from ancient Greece and the Reichstag is worth a visit, too.
      As one of Berlin’s most famous buildings, it offers free entry and an audio guide.

      <h3>Food delivery near you in Berlin</h3>
      <p>Berlin’s food is rich and comforting, particularly on chilly days. Its cuisine is dominated by meat and
        potatoes.
        Currywurst is a grilled sausage so popular it has its own museum. It’s served with sauces and curry powder. If
        you’re a vegetarian, Spatzle is the dish for you, while Konigsberger Klopse are meatballs combined with
        anchovies
        and eggs. They make for a hearty and unusual meal that demands sampling. Schnitzel is Germany’s great export,
        but
        nobody makes it quite as well as the locals. Berlin offers plenty of experimental chefs who are innovative with
        their dishes. Try some French octopus, Icelandic salmon, and fusion food at its finest dining establishments.

        pocket-friendly options near the Hackescher Markt, but for something a little more festive, visit Kreuzberg.
        Schoenberg is also well worth a visit for its atmosphere alone. If you're too busy to go out, why not order a
        lunch from Lieferando.de delivered to the office, or an evening meal if you don't want to cook. If you’re
        craving
